When doing binary search, don't forget to sort the array first;

Search left bound
while(start <= end){
    int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
    if(target <= nums[mid] ){
        if(target == nums[mid]){
            result[0] = mid;
        }
        end = mid-1;
    }else{
        start = mid +1;
    }
}
